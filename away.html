                <p>A Way Out is an action-adventure game, played from a third-person perspective. It was specifically designed for co-op multiplayer with the aid of screen sharing, meaning it can also be played with another player online. In the game, players control Leo and Vincent, two convicted prisoners who must escape from prison and stay on the run from the authorities. As both protagonists' story is told simultaneously, their progress may not be synchronized, which may result in one player being able to control their character while the other is watching a cutscene. Players need to cooperate with each other to progress, and each situation can be approached differently, with both characters taking on different roles. For example, during a prison break scene, one player needs to distract the guard, while another player needs to find a tool to aid their escape. These roles are not fixed, so Leo and Vincent can switch roles in another challenge. Players can interact with many non-player characters and there are dialogue options for players to choose from.
