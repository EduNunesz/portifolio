                <p>The game takes place in a dark fantasy world. The player begins the game by waking up on the shores of Wraeclast, a continent that was once the center of a mighty empire but is now a cursed land that serves as a penal colony for criminals and other unwanted individuals from the nearby Isle of Oriath. Regardless of the reasons for their exile, the player must now brave the unforgiving jungle and its dangerous inhabitants amidst the ruins and bloody secrets of the Eternal Empire and the Vaal civilization that came before, and band together with other exiles to survive. The player controls a single character from an overhead perspective and explores large outdoor areas and caves or dungeons, fighting monsters and completing quests from non-player characters (NPCs) to gain experience points and equipment. The game is heavily inspired by the Diablo series, particularly Diablo II. All areas other than the core camps are randomly generated to increase playability. While all players on a single server can freely mix in camps, gameplay outside of camps is highly instantiated, providing each player or group with an isolated map to freely explore.
