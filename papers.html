                <p>The player impersonates a border immigration agent, who reviews the necessary documentation to enter Arstotzka, a fictional country reminiscent of Eastern European countries at the time of the Cold War. Where civilians and humanitarian aid are allowed to enter. The player, based on the immigration rules of the day, checks the items of a multitude of immigrants who must comply with the immigration rules, being able to interrogate in case of suspicious documentation, allowing or not the entry in the country, or even order arrest if the offense is serious. Because among them are undercover drug dealers, terrorists, etc. The speed with which the player performs his work counts directly on his salary, which must be used to evolve in the type of housing, support the family and acquire advantages in the game.
